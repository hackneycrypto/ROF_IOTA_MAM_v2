## SEEDS

See records.md for seeds and roots. Note that if you leave the Seed blank in the mam.init() then a new seed will be generated by iota libraries.

## TAGS

Can be passed (e.g. ROFTAG) as a Variable to the mam.Attach function.

## DEV AND LIVE TANGLES

Need to change the provider, mam.attach() function variables and the mamExplorerLink

## INSTRUCTIONS

### server.js

Main script for creating new MAM channel with a new seed and then pushing all of the messages to the channel in one go.
Executes all of the pages which are XXX0001_123.html. (i.e. multiple steps executed - order place, items completed etc)

### serverSingle.js

Contains example code of how you can initiate a MAM channel to add a message and then return back later with the same seed and add further messages into the channel. Was working but not tested recently as been entering all records for the MAM channel in one go using `server.js`. Executes the COL0001_1.html page.
